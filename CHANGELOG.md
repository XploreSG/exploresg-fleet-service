---

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Reservation Cleanup**: Expired reservations are cleaned up by scheduled task (5-minute interval)

   - **Impact**: Slight delay in freeing up vehicles from expired reservations
   - **Workaround**: None required - will be freed automatically
   - **Fix Planned**: v1.1.0

2. **Rate Limiting**: Not yet implemented at application level
   - **Impact**: Potential for API abuse
   - **Workaround**: Use API Gateway or reverse proxy rate limiting
   - **Fix Planned**: v1.1.0
