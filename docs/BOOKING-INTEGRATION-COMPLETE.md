# Fleet Service - Booking Integration Setup Complete ✅

## Changes Made for Booking Service Integration

### 1. Security Configuration Updates ✅

**File:** `src/main/java/com/exploresg/fleetservice/config/SecurityConfig.java`

**Changes:**

- ✅ Added `/api/v1/fleet/health` to `permitAll()` - Health check endpoint
- ✅ Added `/api/v1/fleet/bookings/**` to `permitAll()` - Booking endpoints (dev)
- ✅ Added `/api/v1/fleet/reservations/**` to `permitAll()` - Reservation endpoints (dev)
- ✅ Added `http://localhost:8082` to CORS allowed origins - Booking service

```java
.requestMatchers(
    "/hello",
    "/api/v1/fleet/health",              // NEW
    "/api/v1/fleet/models",
    "/api/v1/fleet/bookings/**",         // NEW
    "/api/v1/fleet/reservations/**",     // NEW
    "/v3/api-docs/**",
    "/swagger-ui/**",
    "/swagger-ui.html")
.permitAll()
```

**CORS Configuration:**

```java
configuration.setAllowedOrigins(List.of(
    "http://localhost:3000",    // Frontend
    "http://localhost:8082"     // Booking Service (NEW)
));
```

### 2. Health Check Endpoint Added ✅

**File:** `src/main/java/com/exploresg/fleetservice/controller/HealthController.java`

**Purpose:** Allows booking service to check if fleet service is available before making calls.

**Endpoint:**

```
GET http://localhost:8081/api/v1/fleet/health
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "service": "fleet-service",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T15:30:45.123"
}
```

### 3. Test Script Created ✅

**File:** `test-booking-integration.ps1`

**Purpose:** PowerShell script to test all booking integration endpoints.

---

## Existing Endpoints (Already Implemented) ✅

Your fleet service already has these endpoints that the booking service will use:

### 1. Create Temporary Reservation

```
POST /api/v1/fleet/reservations/temporary
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "modelPublicId": "uuid",
  "bookingId": "uuid",
  "startDate": "2025-01-15T10:00:00",
  "endDate": "2025-01-20T18:00:00"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Reservation created successfully",
  "reservationId": "uuid",
  "vehicleId": "uuid",
  "bookingId": "uuid",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "expiresAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:30"
}
```

### 2. Confirm Reservation

```
POST /api/v1/fleet/reservations/{reservationId}/confirm
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "paymentReference": "stripe_pi_123456"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Reservation confirmed successfully",
  "reservationId": "uuid",
  "vehicleId": "uuid",
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "confirmedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:25"
}
```

### 3. Cancel Reservation

```
DELETE /api/v1/fleet/reservations/{reservationId}?reason=Payment+failed
```

**Response:**

```
204 No Content
```

### 4. Check Availability

```
GET /api/v1/fleet/models/{modelId}/availability-count?startDate={start}&endDate={end}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "availableCount": 5,
  "totalCount": 10,
  "modelId": "uuid",
  "modelName": "Toyota Camry"
}
```

---

## Testing the Integration

### Step 1: Get a Model UUID

Run this SQL query in your database:

```sql
SELECT public_id, name FROM car_models LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 2: Run the Health Check

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/fleet/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"UP","service":"fleet-service","timestamp":"..."}`

### Step 3: Test Availability Check

```powershell
$modelId = "YOUR_MODEL_UUID"
curl "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/fleet/models/$modelId/availability-count?startDate=2025-01-15T10:00:00&endDate=2025-01-20T18:00:00"
```

### Step 4: Test Temporary Reservation

```powershell
$payload = @{
    modelPublicId = "YOUR_MODEL_UUID"
    bookingId = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    startDate = "2025-01-15T10:00:00"
    endDate = "2025-01-20T18:00:00"
} | ConvertTo-Json

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/fleet/reservations/temporary `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d $payload
```

### Step 5: Run Full Test Script

```powershell
# Edit test-booking-integration.ps1 with your model UUID
# Then run:
.\test-booking-integration.ps1
```

## What Booking Service Will Do

The booking service (port 8082) will:

1. **Check Availability** - Before showing cars to users
2. **Create Temporary Reservation** - When user clicks "Book Now" (30-second hold)
3. **Process Payment** - Stripe payment (within 30 seconds)
4. **Confirm Reservation** - If payment succeeds
5. **Cancel Reservation** - If payment fails or timeout

---

## Service Communication Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Booking Service │
│   (Port 8082)   │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ HTTP REST Calls
         │ (No Auth Required - Dev Only)
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Fleet Service   │
│   (Port 8081)   │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Fleet DB      │
│  (PostgreSQL)   │
└─────────────────┘
```

## Security Notes ⚠️

### Development Setup (Current)

- ✅ No authentication required for `/reservations/**` endpoints
- ✅ Fast development
- ⚠️ **NOT suitable for production**

### Production Recommendations

Before deploying to production, implement ONE of these:

1. **Service-to-Service JWT Token**

   ```java
   .requestMatchers("/api/v1/fleet/reservations/**")
       .hasRole("SERVICE")
   ```

2. **API Key Authentication**

   ```java
   @Component
   public class ServiceApiKeyFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
       // Validate X-API-Key header
   }
   ```

3. **Network Security**

   - Deploy services in same private network
   - Use internal DNS/service discovery
   - No public internet exposure

4. **OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow**
   - Most secure for microservices
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Centralized auth server
