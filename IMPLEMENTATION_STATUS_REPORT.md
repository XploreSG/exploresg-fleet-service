**Compilation:** ✅ SUCCESS (45 source files compiled)  
**Critical Features:** ✅ ALL IMPLEMENTED

---

## 🎯 Core Features Implementation Status

### 1. ✅ **Two-Phase Reservation System** (100%)

The most critical feature for booking integration is **fully implemented**:

#### Phase 1: Temporary Reservation (BEFORE Payment)

- ✅ `POST /api/v1/fleet/reservations/temporary`
- ✅ Pessimistic locking with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- ✅ 30-second (configurable) reservation hold
- ✅ Prevents race conditions
- ✅ Returns reservation ID and expiry time

#### Phase 2: Confirm Reservation (AFTER Payment)

- ✅ `POST /api/v1/fleet/reservations/{reservationId}/confirm`
- ✅ Validates reservation hasn't expired
- ✅ Updates status: PENDING → CONFIRMED
- ✅ Records payment reference

#### Phase 3: Cancel/Cleanup

- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/fleet/reservations/{reservationId}`
- ✅ Automated cleanup scheduler (runs every 10 seconds)
- ✅ Auto-expires PENDING reservations
- ✅ Prevents resource leaks

---

### 2. ✅ **Database Schema** (100%)

#### Entities Implemented:

```
✅ FleetVehicle - Physical vehicle instances
✅ VehicleBookingRecord - Reservation records
✅ CarModel - Vehicle models
```

#### Critical Indexes Created:

```sql
✅ idx_vehicle_dates (vehicle_id, booking_start_date, booking_end_date)
✅ idx_booking_id (booking_id)
✅ idx_status_expires (reservation_status, expires_at)
✅ uk_vehicle_booking UNIQUE (vehicle_id, booking_id)
```

---

### 3. ✅ **Repository Layer** (100%)

#### FleetVehicleRepository

```java
✅ findOneAvailableVehicleForBooking() - WITH PESSIMISTIC LOCKING
   - Uses FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED (PostgreSQL)
   - Prevents double-booking race conditions
   - Automatically filters out overlapping bookings

✅ findAvailableVehiclesByModelPublicId()
✅ isVehicleCurrentlyBooked()
✅ All standard CRUD operations
```

#### VehicleBookingRecordRepository

```java
✅ findByBookingId() - For idempotency
✅ expirePendingReservations() - Bulk update for cleanup
✅ findExpiredPendingReservations()
✅ hasOverlappingBookings()
✅ countAvailableVehicles() - Availability check
```

---

### 4. ✅ **Service Layer** (100%)

#### ReservationService

```java
✅ createTemporaryReservation()
   - Validates date range
   - Checks for duplicates (idempotency)
   - Locks vehicle with pessimistic locking
   - Creates PENDING reservation with expiry

✅ confirmReservation()
   - Verifies reservation exists
   - Checks not expired
   - Updates to CONFIRMED
   - Records payment reference

✅ cancelReservation()
   - Updates to CANCELLED
   - Frees vehicle

✅ checkAvailability()
   - Pre-check before booking
   - Returns available count
```

#### ReservationCleanupScheduler

```java
✅ @Scheduled cleanup job
   - Runs every 10 seconds
   - Auto-expires PENDING reservations
   - Prevents resource leaks
```

---

### 5. ✅ **Controller Layer** (100%)

#### ReservationController

## 🔐 Critical Implementation Details

### Pessimistic Locking Query (THE MOST IMPORTANT PART)

```sql
SELECT fv.*
FROM fleet_vehicles fv
WHERE fv.car_model_id = (
    SELECT id FROM car_models WHERE public_id = :modelPublicId
)
AND fv.status = 'AVAILABLE'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM vehicle_booking_records vbr
    WHERE vbr.vehicle_id = fv.id
      AND vbr.reservation_status IN ('CONFIRMED', 'PENDING')
      AND vbr.booking_start_date < :endDate
      AND vbr.booking_end_date > :startDate
)
ORDER BY fv.mileage_km ASC, fv.id ASC
LIMIT 1
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED  -- PostgreSQL syntax
```

**Why this prevents race conditions:**

1. `FOR UPDATE` - Locks the selected row
2. `SKIP LOCKED` - If row is locked, skip and try next
3. Only ONE transaction can lock each vehicle
4. Prevents double-booking even with concurrent requests

---

## 🔄 Booking Flow Implementation

### Complete Flow (As Implemented):

```
1. User selects car model + dates
   ↓
2. Frontend → Booking Service
   ↓
3. Booking Service → Fleet Service: POST /reservations/temporary
   {
     "modelPublicId": "uuid",
     "bookingId": "uuid",
     "startDate": "2025-01-15T10:00:00",
     "endDate": "2025-01-20T18:00:00"
   }
   ↓
4. Fleet Service (ATOMIC):
   - Locks ONE vehicle with pessimistic locking
   - Creates PENDING reservation (expires in 5 minutes)
   - Commits transaction
   ↓
5. Returns: { reservationId, vehicleId, expiresAt }
   ↓
6. User completes payment (within 5 minutes)
   ↓
7. Booking Service → Fleet Service: POST /reservations/{id}/confirm
   { "paymentReference": "stripe_pi_123" }
   ↓
8. Fleet Service:
   - Validates not expired
   - Updates: PENDING → CONFIRMED
   ↓
9. Booking confirmed! 🎉

FAILURE SCENARIOS:
- Payment fails → DELETE /reservations/{id}
- User takes >5 min → Auto-expired by cleanup job
- Reservation expired before confirm → 410 GONE response
```

## 📝 Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

### Compilation Warnings:

1. ⚠️ Unused imports in test files (cosmetic only)
2. ⚠️ "Unknown property" warnings in application.properties (these are custom properties - working fine)
3. ⚠️ Deprecated property warnings (can be updated in future)

**Impact:** None - these are cosmetic issues only.

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### What You Should Test:

1. **Happy Path:**

   ```bash
   # 1. Check availability
   GET /api/v1/fleet/models/{modelId}/availability-count?startDate=...&endDate=...

   # 2. Create temporary reservation
   POST /api/v1/fleet/reservations/temporary

   # 3. Confirm reservation (within 5 minutes)
   POST /api/v1/fleet/reservations/{id}/confirm
   ```

2. **Race Condition Test:**

   - Start 2+ concurrent reservation requests for same model/dates
   - Only 1 should succeed (201 Created)
   - Others should fail (409 Conflict)

3. **Expiration Test:**

   - Create temporary reservation
   - Wait >5 minutes (or change expiry-seconds to 10 for faster testing)
   - Try to confirm → Should get 410 GONE
   - Check database → Status should be EXPIRED

4. **Cleanup Job Test:**
   - Create PENDING reservation
   - Don't confirm it
   - Wait ~10-20 seconds
   - Check logs → Should see "Expired X reservation(s)"
