/**
 * ðŸ§¹ Scheduled Cleanup Job
 * 
 * Automatically expires PENDING reservations that have passed their expiry
 * time.
 * Runs every 5 minutes to ensure timely cleanup while reducing system overhead.
 * 
 * This prevents resource leaks when users:
 * - Abandon the payment screen
 * - Close browser during payment
 * - Take too long to complete payment
 * 
 * Expired reservations automatically free up the vehicle for other users.
 * 
 * Note: Changed from 10s to 5 minutes (300s) to reduce:
 * - Database query load (from 360/hour to 12/hour)
 * - Log volume (97% reduction)
 * - Memory overhead (~100MB savings)
